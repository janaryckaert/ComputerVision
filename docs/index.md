# Introduction to Computer Vision

When I was 17 years old, I did an extra curricular math project in school in which we had to reconstruct a 3D image from photo’s. We would take photo’s from lots of different objects (the most fun was of course taking pictures of ourselves) and then feeding the program these pictures. We had to mark recognition points in each picture, as the program was not yet capable of this, but after that, we could turn our 3D object around in a virtual environment. Of course, as it was a math project, we dived into the math behind this: projections of 3D objects onto a 2D plane and the inverse process of reconstructing the original object. Ever since that moment - which I must say almost felt like magic instead of math - I was intrigued by what a computer could do with images.

So fast forward 10 years, I finished my PhD and I am just eager to keep on learning. I take my search to the internet and find this beautiful course on [Computer Vision](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud810) by Georgia Tech on Udacity. It used a lot of mathematical and computational concepts I already know, so I challenge myself by doing the exercises in Python. A language that I am eager to use more.

## Lesson 1

This first lesson gave me a good idea of what Computer Vision is about and what the current state is. Image processing went a long way from the 3D reconstruction algorithms I learned in secondary school. The applications in sports reporting and smart car systems are well known, but it is the less-known applications that I found most interesting. These techniques can be used to reconstruct a 3D image from an MRI or CT scan , these reconstructed models can subsequently be used during a guided surgery. I am very much looking forward to jump into the practical work.
